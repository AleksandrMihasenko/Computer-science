# Counting Elements

Given an integer array ```arr```, count how many elements ```x``` there are, such that ```x + 1``` is also in ```arr```. If there are duplicates in ```arr```, count them separately.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]
Output: 0
```

#### Constraints:
```
1 <= arr.length <= 1000
0 <= arr[i] <= 1000
```
