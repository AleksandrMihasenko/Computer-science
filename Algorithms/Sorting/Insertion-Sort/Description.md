# Insertion sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with equal values maintain their relative order in the sorted output.

Time Complexity: O(n2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
