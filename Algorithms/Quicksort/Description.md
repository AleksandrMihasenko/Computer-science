# Quicksort

Quicksort is a sorting algorithm, which is leveraging the divide-and-conquer principle. It’s one of the most used sorting algorithms, especially for big data volumes.

It’s important to remember that Quicksort isn’t a stable algorithm. A stable sorting algorithm is an algorithm where the elements with the same values appear in the same order in the sorted output as they appear in the input list.

Complexity O(n log n)).
