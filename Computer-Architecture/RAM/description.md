# RAM

RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that stores data and instructions currently being used by the CPU.
It is volatile, meaning all its contents are lost when the power is turned off.

It serves as the computer's short-term memory, storing data and instructions the CPU needs to access quickly.
Faster than long-term storage (like an SSD or HDD), RAM helps the CPU perform tasks efficiently.
The more RAM a system has, the more applications it can handle simultaneously without slowing down.

DRAM (Dynamic RAM, for general use):
- Most common type of RAM used in computers and other devices.
- Requires constant refreshing of data to maintain it.
- Example: DDR (Double Data Rate) RAM, like DDR4 or DDR5.

SRAM (Static RAM, for CPU cache):
- Faster but more expensive than DRAM.
- Doesn't need constant refreshing.
- Typically used in CPU caches (L1, L2, L3).
