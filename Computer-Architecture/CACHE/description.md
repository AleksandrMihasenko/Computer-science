# CACHE

The CPU cache is a small, high-speed memory located inside or very close to the CPU.
It is used to store frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up processing.
The cache acts as a buffer between the CPU and the slower main memory (RAM).

Accessing data from the cache is much faster than accessing it from RAM because the cache is closer to the CPU and uses faster technology.
It reduces the time the CPU spends waiting for data from RAM.
By keeping frequently used data readily available, the cache significantly enhances overall system performance.

CPU caches are typically organized into multiple levels - L1, L2, L3 caches. They differ in size, speed, and proximity to the CPU.
